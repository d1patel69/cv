  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I have a wide range of experiences from running businesses to technology
    and product management. As a business leader, I had full accountability for strategy definition, refinement, managing P&L’s, multi-year planning and forecasting, M&A, integrating companies and board presentations. On the technology / product
    front my experience spans the full product cycle from long term (10+ years) research to product conception to short term (2 year) roadmaps. The product portfolios I was responsible for have covered the entire hardware / software stack: cloud
    software, embedded software, SoC architecture, chip implementation to transistor level IP. I also have experience in collaborating with academia and government bodies. I have run multi-skilled teams across multiple geographies (US, Europe (UK,
    France, Finland, Israel), Asia (India, China, Taiwan, Japan)).
